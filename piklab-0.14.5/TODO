* fix cname generation for BSSEC/BSSIZ SSSEC/SSSIZ
* 12F609 has no html page (?)

NEXT RELEASES:
* optimize ICD programming/reading: only program/read what's necessary!!
* fix progress bar for tiny bootloader
* check templates are compiling:
   - config & sdcc: cnames sometimes different
* add "test device compatibility" / "merge" / "checksum" commands to "piklab-hex"

- if CTRL+D in konsole: should restart it...
- add stopwatch feature for gpsim
- likeback: grep in project
- missing template generators
- alternate method to direct-program "Vdd first" chips (needed ?)
- fix 16FXXX icd2 debugging: init + reset + ...
- for 18F1230/1330 16F88X: Vdd-F graphs not available yet...
- 18F1330-ICD ?
- set breakpoint in disassembly listing, close, reopen: not displayed...
- pickit2 protocol for firmware 2.01
- Boost: indicate it must be run with NT4 inside toolchain config
- icd2: how to read PORTB from 16F7X7
- support CC8E
- support for other bootloaders (?)
- add serial terminal
- config generator: add missing devices for gpasm/sdcc (18F) + picc + ...
- device power toggle action: problem while running/debugging... (?)
- should be able to read/verify/blankcheck while debugging: restart debug: ask ?
- checksum:
   correct: 10F 12C/F 16C 16F 18C
   partially protected wrong: 18F1220/1320/2220/4220/2331/2431/4431(?) 18F242/248/252/258(?)
   protected wrong: 14000(?) 16C52/54/54A/54B/54C/55/56/56A/57/57C/58A/58B(XOR4)
                    16F873A/874A(?) 16F57/59(?)

                    17C42/42A/43/44/752/756/762/766(XNOR8)
   all wrong: 16C712/715(?) 16C84(?) dsPICs
   datasheet wrong (?): 18F4331
- PICkit2: now supports 16F886/887
- missing registers for some old or new devices
- add option to skip verification step
- PIC30: disassembly listing not working
- GPSIM: add clock speed config
- PICC: no need to compile and assemble in two steps for c files
- PICC: test debugging (from C or ASM files)
- icd2: support more than one breakpoint for 18F
- advanced breakpoints (register, ...)
- escaping in string register entry
- "read all" registers is slow (gui refresh for each read)
- add PC and goto PC in breakpoint list view (?)
- mix different compiler and assembler in a project... (subproject ?)

TODO:
- look into xwisp2/avrdude
- check MPLAB for new devices...
- check endianness: it should be alright since we reading from hex file and outputing strings (?)
- speed-up Pickit1/2 by not programming mask words and by programming 4/n words when possible...
- add log settings: log file / timestamp
- add "random/set_range/..." actions to each range in hex editor
- more filters in device selector
- undo/redo + better selection in hex editor
- library project
- allow saving hex to other formats
- add promate2 / icd1 support
- .lib/.o view
- support dsPIC direct programming
- add option to not autoload firmware (?)
- support for MPASM/MPLINK (mpasm freezes my version of wine...)
- error/warning filter for C30/PICC/JAL/C18
- syntax highlighting for JAL: highlight assembler blocks
- better syntax highlighting for Boost Basic
- "make" action to build only modified files: need to find "includes" in source file for dependencies
- renaming of source files
- PICC Lite windows executable crashes with wine
- support dsPICC: demo windows only and not working with wine
- support direct programming for 16F88X
- support C2C, C2C++, P2C: exception in wine...
- support Proton Basic compiler

Bugs:
- shouldn't we always use the IHX32 format for devices 18 and up ???
- Vdd-frequency graphs ignore different osc/modes...
- gpasm also return 0 on failure (incompatible arguments) as if it is a success...
- COFF disassembly highlighting does not properly highlight multiline comments for C

Devices (XML files):
- check list of devices against MPLAB for missing devices and discrepencies.
- config bits: check config bits from MPLAB
- vdd/freq: not sure I understand the Vdd range in 30F datasheets
- sometimes "vpp" depends on "vdd"...
- revision names...
- 16F630-ICD has lower Vdd requirements for read/write
- 12F6XX-16F6XX-ICD have lower Vdd requirements for bulk erase

- 16C433: config bits datasheet do not agree with progsheet (used progsheet)
- 16CR54/16C557: status ?
- 16HV540: discrepency between datasheet and progsheet for CP bits
- 18F2585/4585/2680/4680: data sheet is wrong for block description (boot block size is variable)

- unknown devices (from gpasm) : 18F2681/F4681/F64J15/F84J15
- 16CR57A ?
- nr: PS501 PS810 PS700
