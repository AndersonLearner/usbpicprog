Loading the firmware in the PIC18F2550

The file Boot/Boot.hex is the bootloader, this file has to be programmed in the pic18f2550 only once with an external programmer

When the bootloader is loaded, the firmware can be programmed / upgraded through piklab:
*Put a jumper on the "self programming header" (the one through which you programmed the bootloader) between the VPP pin and the VDD pin (pin 4 and 5)

*Plug in the usb port

*The firmware in uc_code/uc_code.hex can now be programmed through piklab using "Picdem Bootloader" as a programmer.

*Add a jumper between GND and RB6 of the "self programming header" (pin 1 and 2) to let the usbpicprog firmware load when plugged in the next time.
