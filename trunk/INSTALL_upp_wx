Compilation In Linux
--------------------

Get the latest version of wxWidgets-2.9 (development version) and libusb-1.0 (development version)
Run the following commands.
You might also want to have libglib2.0-dev, automake, autoconf, intltool and some other packages

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

Compilation in Windows
----------------------

-download and extract wxWidgets-2.9.0
-download and install MS visual studio 2008
-start the "ms Visual Studio 2008 command prompt" which is in fact just cmd.exe with some environment variables set
-cd wxWidgets\build\msw
-nmake -f makefile.vc
-set an environment variable WXWIN with the value c:\wxWidgets-2.9.0 (or wherever you have compiled it) and don't forget to reboot afterwards
-now open the right usbpicprog project (usbpicprog\trunk\upp_wx\build\win\upp_wx_vc2008.vcproj)
-you might have to set some include directories, or move around with some files if it doesn't compile right away, but in fact it should compile now!
